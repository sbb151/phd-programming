    "## 1 Looking for patterns in text\n",
    "The heart of text analysis is finding patterns in text. These patterns may be individual words, numbers, symbols, and many more. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *Regular Expression*, or *Regex*, is a sequence of characters that define a text search pattern. Regular expressions are useful in a wide variety of text processing tasks including identifying specific words, phrases, entity names, numbers, url links in text, splitting text into sentences, grouping sentences into categories, etc. For example, we can use regular expressions to identify positive and negative words in a document to subsequently determine its tone, to classify sentences in a document as forward-looking or risk-related, or to classify documents into categories depending if certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the **re** module provides regular expression support. Some commonly used functions from this module include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **re.search(pattern, string)** scans through a string, looking or the first location where the regex **pattern** matches; output is a **Match** object if there is a match, or **None** otherwise;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **re.findall(pattern, string)** finds all substrings where the regex **pattern** matches and returns them as a list;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **re.split(pattern, string)** splits a string at every match of the regex pattern and returns a list of strings. For example, one can retrieve the individual words in a sentence by splitting at the spaces;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **re.sub(pattern, repl, string)** finds all matches of pattern in string and replaces them with **repl**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expression patterns can be specified in either single and double quotation marks, '' and \"\". It is a good practice to insert the letter \"r\" before Regex patterns in Python’s re operations (e.g., **re.search(r'pattern', string)**). Prefixing with \"r\" indicates that backslashes \\ should be treated literally and not as escape characters in Python. In other words, the \"r\" prefix indicates that the string is a \"raw string.\" For example, the following code that demonstrates how to match a basic regex r\"OI\" in a sentence."

    "There are several special purpose characters in regular expressions: .^$*+?\\{\\}\\[\\]\\|()\n",
    "\n",
    "For a special character to be treated literally, we have to add a backslash (\\) before that character. For example, \\$ indicates the dollar sign and \\\\ indicates the backslash. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regex r\"\\\\\\\\$4.99\" will match \\\\$4.99 in \"Apple's Earnings per Share for the three months ended in December 2019 was \\\\$4.99,\" whereas Regex r\"\\\\$4.99\" will return no matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regex r\"S-1\\\\A\" will match S-1\\A in \"Form S-1\\A,\" whereas Regex r\"S-1\\A\" will return no matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Charcter sets in Regex\n",
    "*Character Sets* provide means to match any single character in a given set of characters. To specify a character set, we use square brackets, \\[ and \\]. For example, regex '10-[KQ]' has a character set '\\[KQ\\]' and will match both ‘10-K’ and ‘10-Q’ in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hyphen can be used inside character sets to indicate a range of characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\[a-z\\]** matches any lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z';\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\[A-Z\\]** matches any uppercase letter between 'A' and 'Z';\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\[a-zA-Z\\]** matches any letter in the English alphabet (both upper- and lowercase);\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\[0-9\\]** matches a single digit between 0 and 9;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Negated Character Sets* are used to match any single character except a character from a specified character set. Negated character sets are enclosed in **\\[^ \\]**. For example, **\\[^a-z\\]** matches anything as long as it is not a lowercase letter in the a-z range.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Common Character Sets* have shorthand notations. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **.** matches any character except a newline (i.e., **\\[^\\n\\]**);\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\d** matches a digit character (i.e., **\\[0-9\\]**);\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\D** matches a non-digit character (i.e., **\\[^0-9\\]**); \n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\w** matches a word character (including digits and underscores) (i.e., **\\[a-zA-Z0-9_\\]**);\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\W** matches a non-word character (i.e., **\\[^a-zA-Z0-9_\\]**);\n",

    "- **\\s** matches a whitespace, new line, tab, carriage return, etc. (i.e., **\\[ \\f\\n\\r\\t\\v\\]**);\n",

    "In addition to matching word and non-word characters in text, Regex can match specific positions in text.

    "- **\\Z** matches the end of a string;\n",
    "- **\\b** matches a word boundary and allows “whole word only” searches in the form of '**\\bword\\b**';\n",
    "- **\\B** matches anything but a word boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regex **r\"^inf\"** will match ‘inf’ in “information retrieval,” but not in “retrieval of information”;\n",

    "- Regex **r\"\\bhigh\\b\"** will match ‘high’ in “high income,” but not in “higher income”;\n",

    "### 2.4 Quantifiers in Regex\n",
    "Quantifiers allow to specify whether a Regex element can be matched zero, one, or many times. Quantifiers are always placed after Regex elements. To process text documents, we commonly use the following quantifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **+** matches an item one or more times;\n",
    "- ***** matches an item zero or more times;\n",
    "- **{n}** matches an item exactly n times;\n",
    "- **{k,n}** matches an item at least k times and at most n times; • ? matches an item zero or one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regex **r\"^\\w+\\b\"** will match ‘high’ in “high income” and ‘low’ in “low income”;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regex **r\"\\b19\\d{2}\\b\"** will match any integer number between 1900 and 1999;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regex **r\"\\b\\d{2,3}\\b\"** will match all two- and three-digit numbers in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Groups in Regex\n",
    "Elements of Regex can be grouped together by enclosing them into parentheses, ( ). By default, groups are also captured in addition to the whole regular expression. That is, a regex **Match** object will store the textual value of the complete match as well as textual values of patterns specified in groups. To turn off group capturing, we need to specify ?: after the left parenthesis, i.e., (?: ). Groups are useful for recording specific values in the match and not the whole match. In other words, groups can be thought of as regex sub-patterns. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regex **r\"Total Assets = (\\\\\\\\$\\[\\d,\\\\.\\]+)\\b\"** will match the text “Total Assets = ”, followed by a group capturing the dollar sign \\\\$, one or more numbers \\d, allowing for commas , and periods \\., and a word boundary \\b. Applying this regex pattern to the string “Total Assets = \\\\$10,000,000” will result in two matches: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Full match: ‘Total Assets = \\\\$10,000,000’\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Group match : ‘\\\\$10,000,000’\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regex **r\"Email: (\\[\\w\\\\.-\\]+@\\[\\w\\\\.-\\]+.edu)\"** will match the text “Email: ”, followed by a group capturing either an alphanumeric, ‘.’ , or ‘-’ character \\[\\w\\.-\\] (matched one or many times as in- dicated by ‘+’), followed by the at symbol @, followed again by alphanumeric, ‘.’ , or ‘-’ characters (matched one or many times), and ending with ‘.edu’. Applying this regex to string “Email: abc@ABC.edu” will result in two matches: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Full match: ‘Email: abc@ABC.edu’\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Group match : ‘abc@ABC.edu’\n",
    "    \n",
    "It is possible to specify alternative patterns in Regex using the “or” operator, denoted by |. For example, regex **'Form (10-K|10-Q)'** will match both ‘Form 10-K’ and ‘Form 10-Q’ in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is possible to reuse previous group matches in the same regex. This is called backreferencing. To reference the text matched by the nth group, we use \\n notation in a regex expression. For instance, regex **r\"\\b(\\w+)\\s\\1\\b\"** would capture repeated words in text (e.g., “we we”, “in in”, “above above”, etc.); element \\b(\\w+)\\s captures a word followed by space \\s. The pattern \\1 followed by the boundary \\b captures the result of the first (and only) group, making sure that the second match is not a prefix or beginning of a longer word."
