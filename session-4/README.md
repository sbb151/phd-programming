Let's finish our discussion of merging from last time. How can we attach the initial credit rating onto a dataset that contains a bond identifier, the offering date of the bond, the issue amount, and the yield to maturity? Let's do this only for corporate debentures. For this exercise, we will use data from Mergent FISD, which has been uploaded to this session folder.
