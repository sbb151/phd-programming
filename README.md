# Statistical Programming for Accounting Research
Stata and Python programming for PSU accounting students

## Course objective and content:

The objective of this course is to provide a foundation for accounting doctoral students in statis- tical programming that is relevant to the conduct of empirical accounting research. Students will learn the basic syntax of structured query language (PostgreSQL) to facilitate interaction with the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) cloud-based database. In addition, students will learn the programming language used in Stata, one of the most versatile statistical computing software packages available for research in applied social science fields. Finally, student will receive a high-level introduction to Python, a high-level object-oriented programming language that can be highly useful for interacting with the SEC EDGAR platform, scraping data from websites, and using natural language processing tools to analyze the content of narratives. By the end of the course, students should be prepared to write their own code independently for their own research or in their capacity as research assistants.

## Project:

Each student will choose a published research paper and attempt to replicate the main tables from the paper using Stata. Papers need to be approved in advance for suitability. During the last meeting of the course, students will present their Stata code and any tables generated from the replication exercise.
