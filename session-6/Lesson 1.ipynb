Functions called in this manner rely on positional arguments: the position of the argument in the function call has meaning.

For example, the documentation for re.sub provides this function’s signature:\n",

    "In the modified code, we explicitly told Python that the value of the pattern argument is \"OI\", the value of repl is \"Operating Income\", and the value of string is text.

Python (and many other programming languages) support a construct known as objects and implement “object-oriented programming.” An object is a container for data and may contain its own functions. For example, lists and strings are implemented as objects in Python. Functions that belong to an object are called methods. Methods are called differently than ordinary functions. Recall the append method of the list object. We called it using a different syntax than we use for ordinary functions, e.g., L.append(x). Methods are called by typing an object’s name, followed by a dot (.), followed by the method name, then any arguments in parentheses.\n",
