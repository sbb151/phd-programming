# Session 2 notes


## Practice exercise

Calculate the consensus (mean) EPS forecast for U.S. I/B/E/S covered firms from 2001â€“2005 using only forecasts made within 90 days of the earnings announcement date and then create a variable that captures an analyst's optimism/pessimism relative to the mean forecast. Create an indicator variable for being optimistic and a separate variable for being pessimistic.

When finished, export the company's ticker, fiscal period end date, analyst code, optimism indicator, and pessimism indicator to an Excel file called "analyst-vs-consensus.xlsx"
